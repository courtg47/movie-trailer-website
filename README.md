# Movie Trailer Website

This movie trailer website will populate my top six space-themed movies
on a web page. Each movie's movie poster will be displayed along with the title. 
You may click on the movie poster and the trailer for the movie will pop up and 
play in the middle of the screen. This project is the first project for the 
Udacity Full Stack Web Developer program.

## Credits

The ```fresh_tomatoes.py``` file was supplied by Udacity as a required part of the project. I edited the HTML 
and CSS portions slightly to customize the look. The original file can be found [here on Github](https://github.com/udacity/ud036_StarterCode/blob/master/fresh_tomatoes.py).
