 # Movie Trailer Website

This movie trailer website will populate my top six space-themed movies
on a web page. Each movie's movie poster will be displayed along with the title. 
You may click on the movie poster and the trailer for the movie will pop up and 
play in the middle of the screen. This project is the first project for the 
Udacity Full Stack Web Developer program.
